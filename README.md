## :black_nib: Master's thesis: Bias in language models - Defining, measuring, and reducing bias
In my master's thesis, I discuss bias in language model, especially in defining, measuring, and reducing bias in large language models. Based on the systematic literature review, I critically analyze current methods for measuring gender bias. Due to the fundamental conceptual conflation of bias, the result of existing measurement is misleading..... I urge the importance of theoretical soundness of defining social construct as bias, by suggesting a framework that combines philosophical and computational perspectives on bias in language models.
