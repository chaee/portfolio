# :books: Portfolio of Chaewon Yun 
This is a collection of past projects. I categorized them according to three topics: Technological Ethics, Human-Technology Interactions, and Computational Social Science.

## :book: Master's thesis: Bias in language models - Defining, measuring, and reducing bias
In my master's thesis, I discuss bias in language model, especially in defining, measuring, and reducing bias in large language models. 

- Based on the systematic literature review, I critically analyze current methods for measuring gender bias. 

- Due to the fundamental conceptual conflation of bias, the result of existing measurement is misleading. 

- I urge the importance of theoretical soundness of defining social construct as bias, by suggesting a framework that combines philosophical and computational perspectives on bias in language models.

## :robot: Human-Technology Interaction
I designed an empirical experiment to investigate algorithmic decision making in employment, especially in gig economy.

## :computer: Natural Language Processing 
Lastly, I conducted various NLP projects in the field of computational social science.
